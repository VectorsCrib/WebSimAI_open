# WebSimAI_open
 A local version of WebSim.AI, the prompt to webpage engine. Infinite possibilities to cure your boredom. ( I made it so you dont have to.... Youll thank me later)

Using Lm-Studio with this model "https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF", I was able to get a decent output.

# Instructions:
1. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. To run type `main.py lmstudio` and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
BAM! You should see the web interface.
Enjoy if you got issues let me know please...
